Version 1.6 10-Dec-2002
- Add Object Rexx specific APIs; RexxWaitForTermination() and RexxDidRexxTerminate()
- Add support for Reginald

Version 1.5 18 Aug 2002
- OS/2 port really works now that the DLL name under OS/2 has been truncated
  to DOS 8.3 file name format. This limit of 8 character file names under
  OS/2 is deliberate, believe it or not!

Version 1.4 22 Nov 2001
- Changed method of initialisation for Win32 port.  A change in Windows 2k 
  and XP caused Rexx/Trans to not load Object Rexx or WinREXX DLLs properly.
  Thanks to Jan Engehausen of IBM for suggesting the fix for this.
- Added support for queue and macro API calls.

Version 1.3 24 Jul 2001
- Changed configuration script to use common macros
- Fixed configuration script to build on more platforms
- Preliminary support for REXX/imc - still doesn't work :-(

Version 1.2 18 Nov 2000
- Added support for BeOS
- Removed use of rexxtrans.ini file from Win32 platform. All platforms
  now use environment variables to specify an explicit interpreter or
  turn on tracing of the library.
- Unix port done
- Linux RPM
- OS/2 Support
